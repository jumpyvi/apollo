# Apollo
Apollo is a Arch Linux-based bootc image designed to be a reliable, easy to use and up to date operating system for users as well as a base for others to build tailored experiences off of.

## Current status
Apollo is still experimental and should be considered to be in a **pre-alpha** state. Use with caution; stability is not guaranteed at this time and basic things *will* be missing. You should be fully prepared to report bugs and in general, help is appreciated.

## Installing.
WIP, ISOs are being worked on.

## Building
Apollo is made with mkosi. You can build a bootc-compatible image with the following command:
```bash
just build-bootc
```

To load the built image into your container storage, you can run the following:
```bash
just load
```

To build a bootable image, follow the following commands:
```bash
sudo just load # the next command requires root access
just generate-bootable-image
```

Then you can run the `bootable.img` as your boot disk in your preferred hypervisor. GNOME Boxes is recommended and can be installed as a flatpak with minimal effort.

## Credits
- [bootcrew](https://github.com/bootcrew/) for providing an arch-bootc based image.
- Arch Linux for providing a package base for Apollo.
- Universal Blue for many important parts of the project, such as their homebrew image
